## Libretto

### Overture

### Opening

**D** Do you know the way to Jersey City?

**A** It's next to New York. But New York no longer exists.

**D** New York? Never heard of it.

### Broadway (Sondheim, Bacharach) [Haskell] (London)

**A**\
Everyone knows New York,\
You walk up Broadway to the West End,\
Eat fish and chips\
while waiting at TKTS.

**D**\
My favorite cat is Hask.\
That's the Kleisli arrow, right?\
But what is New York?

### NY Modernism (Berio, Carter, Sessions, Babbitt) [Coq] (Paris)

**B**\
Everyone knows New York,\
The food is unsurpassed.\
From Elaine's to Caf√© Constant,\
You'll never experience better.

**D**\
A tactical advantage.\
I can already taste the coq au vin.\
But where is New York?

**D**\
The large glass. [Sign of the Times by Brian Ferry.]

### NY Minimalism (Reich, Glass) [Racket] (Boston)

**C**\
Everyone knows New York,\
The Metropolitan Museum of Fine Arts.
(Impressionist works.)

**D**\
(What about Monade?)\
xxx\
But when do we arrive?

**Chorus** (Counts matching parentheses.)

### Salsa (Boscan, Blades) [Agda] (Tokyo)

**E**\
Everyone knows New York,\
It's the biggest city in the world.\
A metropolis without end.\
You step out of the East Village Exit\
and Kabukicho spreads out before you.\

**D**\
But surely the termination checker passes.\
I understand the importance of space!\
But why?

### Choral pre-coda

**Chorus**\
TBD

### Coda

**Chorus** This is not PLDI. This is ICFP.
