## Libretto

### Overture

### Opening

**D** Do you know the way to Jersey City?

**A** It's next to New York. But New York no longer exists.

**D** New York? Never heard of it.

### Broadway (Sondheim, Bacharach) [Haskell] (London)

**A**\
Everybody knows New York,\
You walk up Broadway to the West End,\
Eat fish and chips\
while waiting at TKTS.

**D**\
My favorite cat is Hask.\
That's the Kleisli arrow, right?\
But what is New York?

### NY Modernism (Berio, Babbitt) [Coq] (Paris)

**B**\
Everybody knows New York,\
The food is unsurpassed.\
From Elaine's to Caf√© Constant,\
You'll never experience better.

**D**\
A tactical advantage.\
I can already taste the coq au vin.\
But where is New York?

**Chorus** [spoken]\
Sign of the times. The large glass.\
[Proceeding and during the first eight notes ("Here is a rainbow for your hair")
of Sign of the Times by Brian Ferry.]

### NY Minimalism (Reich, Glass) [Racket] (Boston)

**C**\
Everybody knows New York,\
The Metropolitan Museum of Fine Arts.\
(You'll especially enjoy Renoir (Dance at Bougival)\
and Seurat (note the reference to Sondheim\
(I think he went to school near there)).)

**D**\
(I'd plan (synonym) to jump in a lilypond (extension)\
and make a loud noise.)\
(What about Monade? (a portmanteau))\
But when do we arrive?

**Chorus** (Counts matching parentheses.)

### Salsa (Boscan, Blades) [Agda] (Tokyo)

**E**\
Everybody knows New York,\
The biggest city in the world.\
A metropolis without end.\
You step out of the East Village Exit\
and Kabukicho spreads out before you.

**D**\
Surely the termination checker passes.\
I understand the importance of space!\
But why?

### Choral pre-coda

**ABCE + Chorus SA**\
Welcome to Jersey City, the entire world.

**D + Chorus TB**\
Welcome to New York City, the greatest city.

### Coda

**Chorus + ABCDE** This is not PLDI. This is ICFP.
